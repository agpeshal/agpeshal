Welcome to my profile! I am a Deep Learning Engineer with over five years of experience in machine learning and statistics. I have worked for a Computer Vision startup [Pallon](http://www.pallon.com) for more than two years, training and deployed models in object detection (Swin transformers, DETR, FasterRCNN, etc.), image segmentation (Segment Anything Model) and classification over a large set of images. I have worked for IBM Research and Goldman Sachs in the past. Thanks for visiting and I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peshal-agarwal/)!
